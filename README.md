# i3themer

This is a tool for changing the colour and font of windows and status bar in i3wm. It is made with C# in Mono and makes use of the GTK# framework for the UI. This currently has very little error handling and I plan to add more features in the future.
After setting the path to the i3 config file, specify  the colours and font styling you want and it will update the required lines in your config automatically, or set a base colour and generate a colour scheme from that (harmonious, tonal, complementary).
